Notes: 

Given more time I would have implemented a better failure / success HTML pagees.

Multer was key for getting file uploads/saving. Likewise, the documentation was a bear to get through.
Image upload no matter what kind of implementation I tried went first, therefore, I could not try to acccess my form fields before upload and had to worry/manage the image after. 

JSON objects were super easy for both accessing and sending to the backend. 

Node things:
 - npm install
 - node 'xxx'.js


Thoughts:
Overall this assignment was a big step up from the previous work. The implementation of a backend took up tremndous amount of time and validating on the server side took a lot more than I had anticipated. Docker / linking static elements was having troubles . It seemed like it wanted to fight me on every corner, but I did manage to get it working. My HTML/CSS were again not the greatest, but with this point, I felt that looks were the least of my worries.
